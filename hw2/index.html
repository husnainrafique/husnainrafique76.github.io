            <h2>Welcome to Granny's Pies</h2>
            <p>Granny's Pies is a family-owned bakery that has been perfecting the art of traditional pie-making for
                generations.
                Our story began with Grandma Agnes, who spent years perfecting her secret recipes and techniques to
                create the flakiest crusts and most delicious fillings.
                Today, we continue to use only the freshest ingredients and time-honored methods to craft pies that are
                both nostalgic and innovative.</p>

                We believe that pie has the power to bring people together, evoke memories, and create new traditions.
                That's why we're committed to using only the highest-quality ingredients, sourced locally whenever
                possible, and to crafting each pie with love and care.</p>
