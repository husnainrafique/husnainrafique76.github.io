                <h2>Old Town Graught House Grill</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s hard to know where to start. Let’s talk people first. The staff at 1618, from the front desk to
                    the wait team is incredibly engaging and attentive. No less that three team members, other than our
                    waitress, connected with us to ensure we were taken care of. Katie, our waitress, was kind and
                    knowledgeable. Her suggestions were spot on. The food is still, in my view, the best in Greensboro.
                    We started with the calamari which was tender and beautifully seasoned. My wife had the sea bass and
                    I had the seared tuna. I would highly recommend both. The sear on the tuna was delightful. The
                    presentation was amazing as well. Great meal, warm atmosphere and terrific service. Nothing more
                    needs to be said.
                    Old Town Draught House Grill is located at 1205 Spring Garden Street, Greensboro, NC 27403, in the heart of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro's campus.

                        <p> Crab cakes are indeed a classic, especially in Maryland where they are a beloved staple. The

                            itself, often using minimal filler to let the flavor of the crab shine through. Key
                            ingredients typically include lump crab meat, a bit of mayonnaise, some breadcrumbs, and
                            seasonings like Old Bay </p>
